# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster (Kaggle)

This project is my very first Kaggle competition attempt. It is still a work in progress. There is a lot of room for improvement.

I will publish my accuracy score and leaderboard ranking once the project is completed or almost completed.

The objective is simple, we are provided with a train file and a test file. We have to fit our best model on train and make predictions on test. The higher the accuracy score, the higher you are on the leaderboard.
